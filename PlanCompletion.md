- Extracted `BlendControlsContent` from `BlendControlsCard` and reused it inside the layer blend card, eliminating duplicated dropdown/slider wiring while keeping master controls behaviour intact.
- Refactored `LayerBlendPreviewCard` to consume `GifPreviewCard` with the new placement option, aligning the blend preview chrome with the shared stream/master preview treatment without altering enablement logic.
