# Plan Completion Tracker

## Phase Progress
- **Phase 1 – File Extraction:** 100% (completed in prior work; no changes required this session)
- **Phase 2 – Helper Abstractions:** 100% (no regressions observed; kept intact while extending UI layer)
- **Phase 3 – Shared Component Adoption:** 75% (share setup workflow now consumes extracted components alongside existing blend/log/preview reuse; a few niche cards still need evaluation)
- **Phase 4 – Documentation & Tests:** 0% (deferred)

## Session Summary
- Extracted a reusable `ShareSetupCard`/`PlatformPreviewCard` pair so master and future share surfaces can reuse caption, hashtag, and preview UI without duplicating Material patterns.
- Updated `MasterBlendScreen` to consume `ShareSetupCard`, keeping master actions focused on orchestration logic instead of layout plumbing.
- Documented the new shared components in `ENGINEGUIDE.md` so onboarding engineers can find blend, preview, log, and share widgets quickly.

## Next Session TODOs
- Finish Phase 3 by reviewing remaining layer-only cards (e.g., upload/adjustment shells) for feasible extraction without hurting clarity.
- Explore whether blend preview thumbnails can standardize on `GifPreviewCard` or a slimmer variant to remove the last bespoke preview surface.
- Kick off Phase 4 by sketching documentation/test coverage targets once shared components are stable.
- Re-run unit/instrumented tests after configuring `ANDROID_HOME` (current `./gradlew test` attempt fails because the SDK is unavailable).
