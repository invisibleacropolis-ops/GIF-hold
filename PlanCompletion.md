# Plan Completion Tracker

## Phase Progress
- **Phase 1 – File Extraction:** 100% (completed in prior work; no changes required this session)
- **Phase 2 – Helper Abstractions:** 100% (no regressions observed; kept intact while extending UI layer)
- **Phase 3 – Shared Component Adoption:** 60% (completed blend controls wrapper, shared preview card, and FFmpeg log state adoption; further reuse opportunities remain)
- **Phase 4 – Documentation & Tests:** 0% (deferred)

## Session Summary
- Introduced `BlendControlsCard` to centralize enablement, messaging, and progress handling for both layer and master blend controls.
- Added a reusable `GifPreviewCard` and refactored stream previews plus the master preview to consume it for consistent styling and actions.
- Provided `rememberFfmpegLogPanelState` for scroll management and updated both primary screens to use it.

## Next Session TODOs
- Extend Phase 3 by auditing remaining UI for additional reuse candidates (e.g., potential adoption of `GifPreviewCard` for layer blend output or other preview surfaces).
- Evaluate whether further consolidation is needed between layer and master share/setup cards to drive additional reuse.
- Begin planning Phase 4 deliverables (documentation updates and unit tests) once Phase 3 reaches ~100% completion.
- Re-run instrumentation/unit tests once Android SDK configuration is available (current run blocked by missing `ANDROID_HOME`).
