  - Phase 1: 70%
  - Phase 2: 0%
  - Phase 3: 0%
  - Phase 4: 0%

## Session 2025-02-16 - End
- Introduced `ui/resources/LogCopy` to centralize frequently reused log strings and formatting helpers, then updated `LayerScreen` and `GifVisionViewModel` to consume the shared copy without altering behaviour.
- Added `ui/resources/MediaResources` to host the shared video MIME picker array so future import flows draw from a single definition.
- Re-ran `./gradlew test` (still blocked by missing Android SDK) to document the environment gap alongside the new extractions.
- Updated completion estimates:
  - Phase 1: 80% (log/picker copy extracted; outstanding tasks include remaining constant consolidation and scaffolding for render job IDs).
  - Phase 2: 0%
  - Phase 3: 0%
  - Phase 4: 0%
- TODOs for next session:
  - Continue Phase 1 by relocating additional repeated UI strings (e.g., log panel titles, preview empty states) and preparing the render job registry placeholder.
  - Start drafting the structure for validation utility extraction targeted for Phase 2.
  - Plan ENGINEGUIDE updates covering the new `ui/resources` package for later documentation work in Phase 4.
  - Maintain the outstanding action to provision the Android SDK so `./gradlew test` succeeds locally.

## Session 2025-10-15 - Start
- Advancing Phase 1 extraction work with emphasis on consolidating UI panel copy and defining the render job registry helper per PlanDoc recommendations.
- Carried forward completion estimates:
  - Phase 1: 80%
  - Phase 2: 0%
  - Phase 3: 0%
  - Phase 4: 0%

## Session 2025-10-15 - End
- Centralized log panel titles and preview empty state strings in `ui/resources/PanelCopy`, updating layer and master screens plus shared preview components to consume the shared copy.
- Added `media/RenderJobRegistry` and re-pointed FFmpeg request payloads to use the consolidated job ID helpers without changing behaviour.
- Began Phase 2 preparations by extracting stream/layer/master validation models into `ui/state/validation/ValidationModels.kt` for future utility migration.
- Re-ran `./gradlew test` (fails: Android SDK location missing) to capture the persistent tooling blocker with stacktrace context.
- Updated completion estimates:
  - Phase 1: 90% (panel copy consolidation and job registry scaffolding complete; remaining extraction targets limited to residual constants/documentation alignment).
  - Phase 2: 10% (validation models extracted; next step is moving validation functions into dedicated utilities).
  - Phase 3: 0%
  - Phase 4: 0%
- TODOs for next session:
  - Audit remaining UI strings/constants for consolidation to close Phase 1 and prepare ENGINEGUIDE updates.
  - Move validation helper functions (stream, layer, master) into the new `ui/state/validation` package and adjust the view-model to delegate (Phase 2).
  - Outline coordinator scaffolding (e.g., ClipImporter or MessageCenter) to continue Phase 2 delegation work.
  - Continue tracking the missing Android SDK requirement so automated tests can run locally once provisioned.

## Session 2025-10-16 - Start
- Wrapping up outstanding Phase 1 extractions (layout metrics + shared layer copy) before advancing the coordinator work.
- Current completion estimates carried forward:
  - Phase 1: 90%
  - Phase 2: 10%
  - Phase 3: 0%
  - Phase 4: 0%

## Session 2025-10-16 - End
- Finalized Phase 1 by introducing `LayoutMetrics`/`layoutMetricsFor` and `LayerCopy`, then updated layer/master screens and app scaffolding to consume the shared spacing + copy helpers.
- Kicked off Phase 2 by wiring `GifVisionDependencies`, `MessageCenter`, `ClipImporter`, `RenderScheduler`, `ShareCoordinator`, and standalone validation utilities, refactoring `GifVisionViewModel` to delegate to the new helpers while preserving its external API.
- Re-ran `./gradlew test --console=plain` (fails: missing Android SDK) to keep the tooling gap documented post-refactor.
- Updated completion estimates:
  - Phase 1: 100% (all planned extractions and shared resources landed).
  - Phase 2: 60% (core coordinators, dependency surface, and validation utilities established; follow-ups include deeper coordinator coverage tests/documentation).
  - Phase 3: 0%
  - Phase 4: 0%
- TODOs for next session:
  - Continue Phase 2 by covering remaining coordinator scenarios (e.g., cancellation flows, message dedupe rules) and aligning unit boundaries for easier testing.
  - Begin outlining Phase 3 reusable component adoption (blend/log/preview consolidation) now that coordinators are in place.
  - Plan ENGINEGUIDE updates to describe the new dependency + coordinator architecture for Phase 4.
  - Maintain the open action to provision the Android SDK so `./gradlew test` can succeed locally.

## Session 2025-10-17 - Start
- Continuing Phase 2 work focused on the coordinator/message abstractions noted in the prior TODO list.
- Current completion estimates carried forward:
  - Phase 1: 100%
  - Phase 2: 60%
  - Phase 3: 0%
  - Phase 4: 0%

## Session 2025-10-17 - End
- Added a deduplicating window to `MessageCenter` so repeated warnings surface once while still keeping emission APIs lightweight for future unit coverage.
- Extended `RenderScheduler` with active job tracking, cancellation hooks, and consistent job ID registration so stream/layer/master renders can be cancelled without leaking coroutine handles.
- Introduced view-model cancellation entry points that delegate to the scheduler while logging when no active job exists, aligning unit seams for later testing.
- Re-ran `./gradlew test --console=plain` (fails: missing Android SDK) to document the persistent tooling requirement after the coordinator updates.
- Updated completion estimates:
  - Phase 1: 100%
  - Phase 2: 75% (message dedupe + cancellation flows covered; remaining work includes coordinator unit scaffolding and ShareCoordinator edge cases).
  - Phase 3: 0%
  - Phase 4: 0%
- TODOs for next session:
  - Finish Phase 2 by adding coordinator/message unit seams (e.g., injectable clocks, cancellation tests) and reviewing ShareCoordinator persistence flows.
  - Kick off Phase 3 reusable component adoption starting with blend/log shared wrappers once coordinator APIs settle.
  - Begin drafting ENGINEGUIDE updates capturing the coordinator surface and cancellation flows for Phase 4 documentation.
  - Continue tracking the missing Android SDK setup so automated tests can execute successfully.
