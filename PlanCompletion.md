# Plan Completion Log

## Session 2025-02-14 - Start
- Initiating Phase 1 (File Extraction) tasks per PlanDoc.
- Target focus areas:
  - Extract layer feature composables into `ui/layer/` package.
  - Extract master feature composables into `ui/master/` package.
- Current phase completion estimates:
  - Phase 1: 0%
  - Phase 2: 0%
  - Phase 3: 0%
  - Phase 4: 0%

## Session 2025-02-14 - End
- Completed the Phase 1 extraction of layer and master feature composables into dedicated `ui/layer/` and `ui/master/` packages while preserving existing function signatures.
- Updated `GifVisionApp` navigation wiring to reference the relocated screens.
- Recorded Gradle unit test attempt (blocked by missing Android SDK) and logged the environment gap for follow-up.
- Updated completion estimates:
  - Phase 1: 60% (layer/master feature decomposition done; remaining extraction targets include layout policy helper and supporting utilities).
  - Phase 2: 0%
  - Phase 3: 0%
  - Phase 4: 0%
- TODOs for next session:
  - Finish remaining Phase 1 extractions (e.g., window layout helper, shared formatting utilities).
  - Plan Phase 2 coordinator/helper class scaffolding once extraction is finalized.
  - Document updated file layout in ENGINEGUIDE during Phase 4 per plan.
  - Re-run `./gradlew test` once Android SDK path is available to confirm build health.

## Session 2025-02-15 - Start
- Continuing Phase 1 extraction activities with focus on layout policy consolidation per PlanDoc recommendations.
- Current completion estimates carried forward:
  - Phase 1: 60%
  - Phase 2: 0%
  - Phase 3: 0%
  - Phase 4: 0%

## Session 2025-02-15 - End
- Extracted the window layout breakpoint logic into `UiLayoutConfig` within `ui/layout`, keeping behaviour unchanged while preparing for future responsive policy expansions.
- Updated `GifVisionApp` to consume the new layout helper instead of computing width thresholds inline.
- Attempted to run Gradle unit tests (still blocked by missing Android SDK); captured the failure for tracking consistency.
- Updated completion estimates:
  - Phase 1: 70% (layout helper extracted; remaining tasks include consolidating shared formatting utilities and other residual helpers).
  - Phase 2: 0%
  - Phase 3: 0%
  - Phase 4: 0%
- TODOs for next session:
  - Continue Phase 1 by moving shared formatting/constants into dedicated utility files as outlined in PlanDoc.
  - Begin identifying candidates for validation and coordinator extraction ahead of Phase 2.
  - Prepare ENGINEGUIDE updates outlining the new layout package for Phase 4 documentation.
  - Re-attempt `./gradlew test` after addressing Android SDK availability or capturing the requirement for tooling setup.

## Session 2025-02-16 - Start
- Resuming Phase 1 with emphasis on consolidating shared log and picker copy into reusable helpers per PlanDoc section 3.4.
- Carrying forward completion estimates:
  - Phase 1: 70%
  - Phase 2: 0%
  - Phase 3: 0%
  - Phase 4: 0%

## Session 2025-02-16 - End
- Introduced `ui/resources/LogCopy` to centralize frequently reused log strings and formatting helpers, then updated `LayerScreen` and `GifVisionViewModel` to consume the shared copy without altering behaviour.
- Added `ui/resources/MediaResources` to host the shared video MIME picker array so future import flows draw from a single definition.
- Re-ran `./gradlew test` (still blocked by missing Android SDK) to document the environment gap alongside the new extractions.
- Updated completion estimates:
  - Phase 1: 80% (log/picker copy extracted; outstanding tasks include remaining constant consolidation and scaffolding for render job IDs).
  - Phase 2: 0%
  - Phase 3: 0%
  - Phase 4: 0%
- TODOs for next session:
  - Continue Phase 1 by relocating additional repeated UI strings (e.g., log panel titles, preview empty states) and preparing the render job registry placeholder.
  - Start drafting the structure for validation utility extraction targeted for Phase 2.
  - Plan ENGINEGUIDE updates covering the new `ui/resources` package for later documentation work in Phase 4.
  - Maintain the outstanding action to provision the Android SDK so `./gradlew test` succeeds locally.

## Session 2025-10-15 - Start
- Advancing Phase 1 extraction work with emphasis on consolidating UI panel copy and defining the render job registry helper per PlanDoc recommendations.
- Carried forward completion estimates:
  - Phase 1: 80%
  - Phase 2: 0%
  - Phase 3: 0%
  - Phase 4: 0%

## Session 2025-10-15 - End
- Centralized log panel titles and preview empty state strings in `ui/resources/PanelCopy`, updating layer and master screens plus shared preview components to consume the shared copy.
- Added `media/RenderJobRegistry` and re-pointed FFmpeg request payloads to use the consolidated job ID helpers without changing behaviour.
- Began Phase 2 preparations by extracting stream/layer/master validation models into `ui/state/validation/ValidationModels.kt` for future utility migration.
- Re-ran `./gradlew test` (fails: Android SDK location missing) to capture the persistent tooling blocker with stacktrace context.
- Updated completion estimates:
  - Phase 1: 90% (panel copy consolidation and job registry scaffolding complete; remaining extraction targets limited to residual constants/documentation alignment).
  - Phase 2: 10% (validation models extracted; next step is moving validation functions into dedicated utilities).
  - Phase 3: 0%
  - Phase 4: 0%
- TODOs for next session:
  - Audit remaining UI strings/constants for consolidation to close Phase 1 and prepare ENGINEGUIDE updates.
  - Move validation helper functions (stream, layer, master) into the new `ui/state/validation` package and adjust the view-model to delegate (Phase 2).
  - Outline coordinator scaffolding (e.g., ClipImporter or MessageCenter) to continue Phase 2 delegation work.
  - Continue tracking the missing Android SDK requirement so automated tests can run locally once provisioned.
